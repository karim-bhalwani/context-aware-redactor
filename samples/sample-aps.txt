Echo Consultation Report 
Date of Exam: October 7, 2025 
Facility: City General Hospital 
Patient: John Doe 
PIN/MRN: 982231 
Ordering MD: Dr. Emily Chen 
Reporting Consultant: Dr. Lisa Ng 

INTERPRETATION SUMMARY
An image enhancing agent (Definity) was used.
The left ventricle is severely dilated. Left ventricular systolic function is globally severely reduced.
Ejection Fraction (EF) = 25-30%.
The right ventricle is mildly dilated with moderately reduced systolic function.
Mitral valve appearance is consistent with previous repair. Mild residual mitral regurgitation.
Right ventricular systolic pressure is estimated at <20mmHg.

Compared with prior report (July 26, 2025), the cardiac rhythm is now atrial fibrillation and there is a reduction in left and right ventricular systolic function.

Operative Report
Date of Operation: July 24, 2025
Facility: City General Hospital
Patient: John Doe
PIN/MRN: 982231
Surgeon: Dr. Emily Chen

Preoperative Diagnosis: Severe mitral regurgitation, bileaflet prolapse.

Postoperative Diagnosis: Same.

Operative Procedure: Minimally invasive complex mitral valve repair (posterior leaflet neo-chordae loop reconstruction x3, 38 mm Future ring annuloplasty).

Operative Note: 
The procedure was successful. Postoperative transesophageal echo demonstrated excellent mitral valve reconstructive results with no significant mitral insufficiency and preserved biventricular function at the time.

Clinic Follow-up Note - Cardiovascular Surgery
Date of Clinic: October 14, 2025
Physician: Dr. Emily Chen
Mr. John was seen for a telephone follow-up post-mitral valve repair. He reports feeling well with good energy and denies chest pain or shortness of breath.
However, a recent transthoracic echo has unfortunately shown that his left ventricular ejection fraction has fallen to 25-30% with moderate right ventricular dysfunction. An ECG demonstrates atrial fibrillation.

Impression: 
The fall in left ventricular function is likely related to the new onset of atrial fibrillation and the acute change in loading conditions on his left ventricle post-repair.

Plan:
1. Recommend arranging electrical cardioversion.
2. Recommend up-titrating afterload medications (Perindopril, Metoprolol) to improve LV function.
3. Will continue to follow with annual transthoracic echoes.

Holter Monitor Report

Date of Study: November 30, 2025

Facility: Valley Regional Medical Center
Interpreting Physician: Dr. Mark Green

Rhythm: Baseline rhythm was atrial fibrillation with an average heart rate of 55 BPM (range 31-120 BPM).

Arrhythmia: 483 ventricular ectopic beats.

Pauses: There were 2.5-second pauses, and at 09:23 on day 2, there was a 4-second pause.

Conclusion: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular rate. Isolated multifocal PVCs. No other rhythm abnormalities.

Recommendation: If symptoms of syncope or pre-syncope occur, recommend assessment for a pacemaker.

Orthopedic Surgery & Correspondence

September 9, 2024 (Dr. David Patel): Patient seen in follow-up for a prior right shoulder operation. He is doing well. He is now symptomatic on his left shoulder. Plan to investigate with X-ray and MRI, but asked him to delay until after his planned cardiac procedure.

February 20, 2025 (Letter from Dr. Sullivan to Dr. Patel): Inquiring if shoulder surgery could proceed prior to heart surgery due to patient's significant pain and heavy work in construction.

February 27, 2025 (Response from Dr. Patel): "Sorry but safest for Mr. John [to wait for] elective shoulder [surgery]."

March 3, 2025 (Letter from Dr. Sullivan to Dr. Chen): Informing Dr. Chen that the patient is awaiting left shoulder surgery with Dr. Patel, which cannot proceed until his mitral valve is corrected, and hoping the cardiac surgery can be done as soon as possible.
